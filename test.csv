#LEOSatellite #Connectivity #DigitalTransformation #BrilliantMadeSimple","We recently co-sponsored iTnews executive roundtables with NEXTDC, bringing together senior technology leaders to tackle a critical challenges. 

The conversations focused on enabling real time, distributed data access and managing the performance demands of multi-agent AI. Key insights emerged around how CIOs balance risk, cost and future-readiness when supporting emerging AI workloads.
 
These discussions highlight why modern infrastructure partnerships matter. As organisations accelerate AI adoption, the gap between ambition and infrastructure reality continues to widen - creating opportunities for providers who understand both connectivity and compute requirements.
 
Thanks to ITNews for hosting the sessions and all the executives who attended and provided their learnings and insights.
